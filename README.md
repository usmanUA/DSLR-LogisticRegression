# DSLR Project

The DSLR (Data Science and Logistic Regression) project from 42 School is centered around implementing logistic regression to classify and analyze data from a given dataset. This project aims to provide students with a practical understanding of machine learning principles, particularly logistic regression, data preprocessing, and model evaluation.

## Features

- **Data Preprocessing**: Reads and cleans data to prepare it for analysis and model training.
- **Logistic Regression Implementation**: Implements logistic regression from scratch to classify data points effectively.
- **Model Training and Testing**: Trains the logistic regression model using a dataset and evaluates its performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, and recall.
- **Data Visualization**: Visualizes data distribution and model predictions to gain insights into the classification process.
